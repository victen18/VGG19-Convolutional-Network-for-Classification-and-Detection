## VGG19-Convolutional-Network-for-Classification-and-Detection

VGG-19 is a convolutional neural network that is 19 layers deep. You can load a pretrained version of the network trained on more than a million images from the ImageNet database . The pretrained network can classify images into 1000 object categories, such as keyboard, mouse, pencil, and many animals.
